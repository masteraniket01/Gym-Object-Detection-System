# Gym Object Detection System Using YOLO Model

Excited to share my latest project where my love for data and fitness collide! ðŸš€ As a data scientist, I dive deep into complex datasets, turning numbers into actionable insights. 

Simultaneously, I'm a gym buff, and in my newest venture, I've created Own custom datasets and used YOLO for Custom object detection. This means I can spot gym gear like Barbell, Dumbbells, Weight Plates, and Spring Lock Clamps in this Video. ðŸ’¡ It's not just about tech for me; it's about making workouts safer and more effective.

This fusion of data science and fitness not only showcases my technical prowess but also contributes to a safer and more efficient workout environment. Join me on this journey where data-driven insights meet the world of wellness ðŸ™‚
